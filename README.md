`jx promote` is an experimental binary plugin to promote applications to a [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) environment

## Getting Started

Download the [jx-alpha-promote binary](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-promote/releases) for your operating system and add it to your `$PATH`.

There will be an `app` you can install soon too...

## Importing Repositories and Creating Quickstarts

Just run the `jx alpha promote` command line and follow the instructions as if it were `jx promote`.
